# Architect Arithmetic
Architects have big ideas - but big ideas can be expensive. How expensive? Depends on the size.

In this proect, you'll use methods to build a program that calculates the material cost for any architect's floor plan. 
For example, the floor plan of the Pantheon in Rome, Italy can be approximately broken into circles and rectangles. Using basic formulas, we can calculate the area of each shape and find the total. You'll be defining area methods like Circle() and Rect(). Finally, we multiply the total are by the cost of each unit of flooring material.
