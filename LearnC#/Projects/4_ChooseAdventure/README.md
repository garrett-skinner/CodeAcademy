# Choose Your OWn Adventure
In this project, you'll use logic and conditional statements to write a classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game.
Depending on what choices your user makes the program will have a different result. While we're only working with text, the principles of user input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.
